# The Odin Project Foundations - Landing Page Project

## A landing page that now combines both HTML and CSS to further cement knowledge gained during the foundational stages of the learning process.

This project taught me the following:

- How to use CSS to style the HTML that was written
- Basic knowledge of the cascade order
- Setting up root variables for things like colors, gutters, etc.
- The beginnings of mobile-first responsive design
- Continued work with writing commit messages
